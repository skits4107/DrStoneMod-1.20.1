# Dr Stone Mod
In this mod I have aimed to make a recreation of various items and tools from the popular anime/manga dr stone written by Riichiro Inagaki and illustrated by the South Korean artist Boichi and animated by TMS entertainment.
This mod is currently a work in progress.

# So far:
I have gotten a basic petrification system working allowing you to petrify any living entity. still need to get to undoing petrification and some other things such as better art and other effects.

#Credits
I would like to acknowledge the contributions of Raptorfarian and Alexthe666, the creators of the Ice and Fire mod. Their work has influenced the development of this project. Specifically, 
I have used and modified substantial portions of code from their 'stone statue' and 'stone statue renderer' classes under the LGPL-3.0 license. This code is implemented in my 'petrified entity' class and 'petrified entity renderer' within this Dr. Stone themed mod.
These acknowledgments are not only present here in this README but are also clearly indicated through comments within the respective classes where their code has been utilized and adapted.
here are links to the classes are borrowed from:
